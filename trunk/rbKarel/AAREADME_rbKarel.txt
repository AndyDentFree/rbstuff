See http://code.google.com/p/rbstuff/wiki/rbKarel for more information

Conceptual port of "Karel the Robot" http://karel.sourceforge.net/ to REALbasic
but using the built-in RBScript language rather than writing our own parser, which 
means examples written here will also work as source within REALbasic programs.

The KarelScripts and KarelWorlds folders contain collections of sample code and worlds.

If you copy them to the location next to the executable, your Documents or Shared Documents folders, they
will be found automatically and add menus Scripts and Worlds to the menu bar.
