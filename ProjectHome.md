A collection of demo programs for REALbasic illustrating aspects such as using RBScript, graphics and other popular downloads. Moved here so they can be maintained as open source with version control.

Includes [rbKarel](http://code.google.com/p/rbstuff/wiki/rbKarelOverview) - a REALbasic implementation of _Karel the Robot_ using RBScript as the Karel programming language.
