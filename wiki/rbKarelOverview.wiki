#summary REALbasic adaption of Karel the Robot.
#labels Featured

== Introduction ==

Conceptual port of "Karel the Robot" to REALbasic
but using the built-in RBScript language rather than writing our own parser, which 
means examples written here will also work as source within REALbasic programs.

Note that this version is not based on any source code from any previous Karel implementations, just on  [http://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/karel/ public documentation] of how Karel works.

== Goals ==
  * Implement a first version very quickly but without disappearing down too many confining rat holes.
  * Compromise the parser by using RBScript so don't try to copy everything in the classical language.

== Nice to have ==
  * user override of drawing Karel, beepers, walls, background
  * able to paste in examples from classical Karel
  * simpler graphical way to handle some things like drawing walls
  * drawing pictures that are selected through File Open dialogs and remembered as named graphics (or file paths)
  * Karel-centric drawing so the drawing primitives exposed through GraphicsScripter can be used without explicit coords - does this imply things like squares and circles are logically centred on Karel's location?  
  * debugger with ability to break based on Karel's state as he moves, so you could stop as he got close to a wall (without explicitly writing this into the Karel program)
