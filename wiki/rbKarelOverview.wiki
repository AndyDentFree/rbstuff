#summary REALbasic adaption of Karel the Robot.
#labels Featured

== Introduction ==

Conceptual port of "Karel the Robot" [http://karel.sourceforge.net/ Java version] to REALbasic
but using the built-in RBScript language rather than writing our own parser, which 
means examples written here will also work as source within REALbasic programs.

See also the [http://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~untch/karel/ Karel home page]

== Goals ==
  * Implement a first version very quickly but without disappearing down too many confining rat holes.
  * Compromise the parser by using RBScript so don't try to copy everything in the classical language.

== Nice to have ==
  * able to paste in examples from classical Karel
  * simpler graphical way to handle some things?
