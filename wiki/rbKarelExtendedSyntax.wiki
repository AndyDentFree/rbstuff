#summary Extensions in rbKarel of the traditional Karel language

Drawing:
  * All the colors and graphics drawing primitives in GraphicsScripter 
  * `Avenue2Y` - convert an avenue number to a coordinate for use with graphics
  * `Street2X` - convert a street number to a coordinate for use with graphics

Karel control:
  * `ErrorShutdown` - the handler called when do something illegal 
  * `IsRunning` - true if Karel is running, ie: after a TurnOn and no error or TurnOff
  * `MovePause` - number of seconds to pause at each move
  * `Wait` - the delay method, takes a number of seconds. Used internally to implement the MovePause and I thought I may as well make it available to the Karel user

Other Features:
  * `Say` - invokes the REALbasic Speak command
