#summary Adapting classic Karel syntax to rbKarel.

== How we might cope ==

A simple program like that on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language) Wikipedia] looks like

{{{
BEGINNING-OF-PROGRAM
 
 DEFINE turnright AS
 BEGIN
   turnleft;
   turnleft;
   turnleft
 END
 
 BEGINNING-OF-EXECUTION
   ITERATE 3 TIMES
     turnright;
     move;
     turnoff
 END-OF-EXECUTION
 
END-OF-PROGRAM
}}}

We can process that text before running it in RBScript to sanitise a few obvious points:
  * if multiple statements are separated by semi-colons on a single line, break onto multiple lines
  * remove semi-colons at the end of the line
  * if a THEN statement is on a new line put it on the previous line
  * strip  BEGINNING-OF-PROGRAM and END-OF-PROGRAM and any text before or after what they bracket
  * translate routine definitions into subroutines

{{{
DEFINE turnright AS
 BEGIN
...
 END
}}}

becomes
{{{
Sub turnright
...
End Sub
}}}
