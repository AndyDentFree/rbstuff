See http://code.google.com/p/rbstuff/wiki/ScriptPictureEffects for more information

Comprehensive sample showing how to use RBScript to allow code to be typed in 
to draw graphics. 

Includes a class which exposes the drawing interface of the Graphics class as well as 
Einhugur's PictureEffects plugin. 
http://www.einhugur.com/Html/PictureEffects/index.html

IMPORTANT Can be compiled without PictureEffects and other Einhugur plugins.
Choose your project from:
	HavePictureEffects/ScriptPictureEffects.rbvcp or
	NoPictureEffectsInstalled/ScriptPictureEffectsNoEinhugur.rbvcp

Either example app includes several scripts on a popup menu - a great way to try out the effects and drawing code!
